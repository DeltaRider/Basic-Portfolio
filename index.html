            <p>My name is Josh Deitz and this is my official website.

                This site will guide you through various aspects of my personal life and professional career. I've also included a digital portfolio that highlights some of my best photography, design, and writing projects.
                    
                Everything you find on this site, including the site itself and its background photo, is 100% original work completed by me. Photos from the internet, code templates, and easy build websites like Wordpress were not used to create any part of this website.
                    
                Feel free to contact me for information about anything you find on joshdeitz.com. Thank you!
